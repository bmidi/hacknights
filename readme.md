# Hack Nights @ newhaven.io proposal
## OUTCOMES
### MEMBER ENGAGEMENT
Hack Nights should involve a high level of user engagement prior to the event. Events will be determined by suggestion and polling system that extends throughout the month. After the initial stage, ideas will move on to polling. (Ideas might involve multiple levels of polling depending on how granular the goal). The goal should be chosen at least 72 hours before the event, so the event title can be updated to reflect the goal. The point of this is to make the event feel entirely member driven.
### ENCOURAGED LEARNING
Hack Nights should be designed to encourage teaching and involving everyone. They should not only be designed to attract professionals and experts, but encourage newbies to attend, shadow, and jump in when they feel comfortable. Of course, Hack Nights should not be designed as ‘social hours’ (more on that later), so keeping conversation focused on the goal at hand is most important.
### INDUSTRY-STANDARD COLLABORATION
Hack Nights should incorporate industry-standard tools (e.g. Trello, GitHub) used for collaboration. An important outcome of Hack Nights is to teach people valuable skills in teamwork. It’s almost expected to come out of a CS degree with little experience with these professional tools and mindsets, so incorporating them into Hack Nights can be highly valuable to those interested in working with others.
## LOGISTICS
### ANTI- ‘SOCIAL’ EVENTS
This might seem contradictory to the desired outcomes of the events, but Hack Nights are not ‘social’ events; they are goal-oriented events. Hack Nights should be separate from ‘mixers’ where members come to talk about work and life and should encourage active engagement in the pre-determined goal. New members should attend a bi-weekly Byte Brunch or one of the social hours first. This rule should be enforced based on discretion in a polite manner, we don’t want to shut down anyone from contributing ideas.
### PRIVATE SETTING
Events should be hosted in a private setting in order to keep everyone focused on the goal. Coffee shops and bars are great for Byte Brunches and Social Hours, but in order to keep everyone’s attention, these events should ideally be hosted in a private environment.
### TIME CONSCIOUS PLANNING
It is expected that Hack Night goals should take anywhere from 4-8 hours to complete. The time of the event can be voted on along with the goal, and time to completion is an important matter to voice an opinion on. Members should expect to be given enough time to complete a goal, so scheduling enough time at the location of the Hack Night is important.
